= Creating a Standard Cluster
:description: Standard clusters are ideal for small or medium applications that need the flexibility to automatically scale up or down depending on the amount of used memory.

== Before you Begin

To create a cluster for a team, you must have either an admin or developer role. See xref:teams-and-users.adoc[].

== Create the Cluster

. Click *Plans & Pricing* in the header.

. In the Standard plan, click *Create Cluster*.

. Select a region.
+
NOTE: For best performance, choose a region that's closest to your client applications. The closer your clients are to the cluster, the lower the network latency.

. Select the total amount of cluster memory that you will need for each member.
+
Small clusters provision 1 GB of memory to each member. Medium clusters provision 5 GB of memory to each member.
+
You cannot change from Small to Medium after the cluster is created.
+
For details about the cost per GB per hour, see xref:pricing.adoc[].

. To encrypt communications between clients and your cluster, turn on TLS Encryption.
+
You cannot change this selection after the cluster is created.

. If you want to restrict which clients can to connect to your cluster, add those clients' IP addresses to the IP Whitelisting field.

. If you want to persist cluster data on disk, turn on Persistence.
+
You cannot change this selection after the cluster is created.
+
WARNING: Persisting data can degrade throughput by up to 40%.

. If you want to back up persisted data in cloud storage, turn on Hot Backup.
+
You cannot change this selection after the cluster is created.

. To configure data structures before starting your cluster, click *Data Structures Configuration*.
+
TIP: You can also add data structure configuration after the cluster is created.

. Enter a name for your cluster and click *CREATE CLUSTER*.

It takes between 3-5 minutes to create a Standard cluster. During this period, your cluster will be in a pending state. When the cluster state changes to running, you will be able to use it.
