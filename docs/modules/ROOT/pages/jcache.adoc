= JCache

== JCache Name

In Hazelcast, you can create custom jcache configurations associated with the names of jcaches. The jcaches that do not have any configuration defined use the default configuration. If you want to set a configuration that is valid for all jcaches, you can name your configuration as `default`. A user-defined `default` configuration applies to every jcache that does not have a specific custom jcache configuration defined with the jcache's name. 
You can also use wildcards to associate your configuration with multiple jcache names. See the configuration documentation] for more information about wildcards.

== Backup Count

Number of synchronous backups/replications. The higher number the more highly available cluster but performance decreases and memory cost of each entry increases. Synchronous backup operations have a blocking cost which may cause the higher latencies.

== Asynchronous Backup Count

Number of asynchronous backups/replications. The higher number the more highly available cluster but performance decreases and memory cost of each entry increases. Asynchronous backups are fire & forget and do not require the acknowledgements.

== Key Type

Fully qualified class name of the cache key type. Its default value is `java.lang.Object`.

== Value Type

Fully qualified class name of the cache value type. Its default value is `java.lang.Object`.

== Eviction Policy

Eviction policy that compares values to find the best matching eviction candidate. Its default value is `LRU` (less recently used).

== Max Size Policy

Maximum size policy. If maximum size is reached, the cache is evicted based on the eviction policy. 

== Maximum Size

Maximum free/used percentage or maximum size in bytes depending on the selected `maxSizePolicy`.

== Time To Live

Time-to-live for cache entries, in seconds.
